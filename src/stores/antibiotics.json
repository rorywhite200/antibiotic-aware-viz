Neomycin is a complex comprised of three components, neomycin A, B, and C. Neomycin B, also known as framycetin, is the most active component of the complex and neomycin C is the isomer of neomycin B, making these two stereoisomers the active components of neomycin. Neomycin A, or neamine, is a moiety that conjoins two molecules of neomycin B and C together. Neomycin is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms and mediates its pharmacological action by binding to bacterial ribosomes and inhibiting protein synthesis, which is crucial for the survival of bacteria. \r\n\r\nNeomycin sulfate is the most common form for pharmaceutical preparations; because the compound is a complex, the amount of neomycin in products is measured in units.
